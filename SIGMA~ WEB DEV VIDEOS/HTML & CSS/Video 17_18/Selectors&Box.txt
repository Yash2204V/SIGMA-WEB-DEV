This is the text based summary of the things you have to use while implementing the function in the tags:

^Selectors:
div           : Block element
div > p       : This is the first child in the div which is mentioned in the style tag
div p         : This include all the paragraph mentioned in the div
*             : This is universal tag used to include the property to all the function
#             : This is the id Selector used to mention the change in only one unit
.             : This is used to define the property to more than one unit
p:first-child : This is used to define only when the p is the first child.


^Box define:
@ The basic thing here is to first mention (MARGIN AND PADDING), then mention the (BORDER) with some solid colour.

@ Then mention the height of the box, 
[
(Box sizing: border-box)~ included then it will add upto the margin means...
{
    M | B | P | C (+ all) ~ included [box sizing: border-box] while also mentioning the [height].
    C (only content) ~ if not included.
}
]

@ For text decoration we use underline and then to decorate the text decorator we use the --color property(txt specific)
